# Maze-Generation-Game
- This is a Maze Generation Game using HTML, CSS and Javascript
- While working on this project I learned how to set up the basic HTML structure and style it using CSS to create a visually appealing game interface. 
Then, while diving into the JavaScript code I used an algorithm called Depth-First Search to generate the maze.
